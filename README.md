# cleancentive

Empowering communities to make the world visibly cleaner.

## What is cleancentive?

Every piece of litter you pick up matters. Cleancentive helps you see your impact by turning your cleanup efforts into data you can track, share, and celebrate.

Simply take a photo of the litter you've collected. Cleancentive automatically identifies what you found—plastic bottles, cigarette butts, aluminum cans—and pins it on a map. Watch your personal impact grow and see how your neighborhood is getting cleaner, one pickup at a time.
