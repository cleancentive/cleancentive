# Project context
# This is shown to AI when creating artifacts.
# Add your tech stack, conventions, style guides, domain knowledge, etc.
context: |
  Tech stack: Bun runtime and package manager, NestJS (backend API), React + Vite (frontend PWA), PostgreSQL with PostGIS (database), MinIO (object storage), Redis + BullMQ (job queue), OpenAI Vision API (image analysis), MapLibre GL + OpenStreetMap (mapping)
  Conventions: Conventional commits, TypeScript, monorepo with Bun workspaces, Avoid referencing "cleancetive" in the specs - prefer "The solution", use relative file paths
  Data Model Guidelines: All persisted entities have UUIDv7 as identifier, creation timestamp, created_by foreign key to user; mutable entities have update timestamp and updated_by foreign key to user; user accounts can only be updated by the user itself (created_by = updated_by = user UUID)
  Domain: Environmental cleanup and litter tracking app (Cleancentive) - reimplementation of Delitter with fixes for data persistence and architecture issues
  Paths: use relative paths in the specs, e.g. "../changes/user-identity-management/.openspec.yaml" instead of absolute paths

# Per-artifact rules
# Add custom rules for specific artifacts.
# Example:
#   rules:
#     proposal:
#       - Keep proposals under 500 words
#       - Always include a "Non-goals" section
#     tasks:
#       - Break tasks into chunks of max 2 hours
